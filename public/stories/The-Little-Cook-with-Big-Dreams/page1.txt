In a cozy little village nestled between rolling green hills and sparkling blue streams, there lived a young boy named Marco. Marco was a cook, and though he was small, his dreams were enormous. He had short, curly brown hair that always seemed to have a bit of flour in it, and big, bright green eyes that sparkled with excitement whenever he talked about food. His slightly tanned skin showed he spent a lot of time outdoors, picking fresh herbs from his little garden.

Marco lived in a tiny stone cottage with his grandmother, who was famous for her delicious recipes. The cottage had a thatched roof, and vines with blooming flowers climbed up its walls. The inside was warm and inviting, with wooden beams, shelves full of cookbooks, and the delicious aroma of baked bread always in the air.
