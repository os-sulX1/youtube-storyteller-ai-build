Once upon a time, in a colorful village nestled between rolling green hills, there lived a man named Bruno. Bruno was incredibly strong â€“ he could lift giant boulders, pull the heaviest wagons, and even carry a whole tree on his shoulders! But what made Bruno special wasn't just his strength; it was his big, kind heart. He loved kids more than anything in the world, and the village children adored him in return.

Every day after he finished his chores, Bruno would gather the kids in the village square. He would play fun games with them, tell them exciting stories, and teach them new skills. The kids would climb all over him, laughing and shouting with joy. They trusted Bruno completely because his warm smile and gentle nature made them feel safe and cherished.
