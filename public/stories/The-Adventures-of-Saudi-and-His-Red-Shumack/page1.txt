Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the golden dunes and clear blue skies of Arabia, there lived a boy named Saudi. Saudi was a curious and adventurous child, always eager to explore the world beyond his village.

Saudi had deep brown eyes that sparkled with excitement, and his sun-kissed skin glowed with health. His hair was as dark as the night sky, and he wore it in neat, short curls that framed his face perfectly. But the most notable aspect of Saudi's appearance was his beloved red Shumack. The Shumack, a traditional Saudi Arabian garment, was bright red and always fluttered in the wind as if it had a personality of its own. It was his most treasured possession, given to him by his grandfather, who had traveled the world with it many years before.

One day, Saudi decided to venture out on a grand journey. He packed a small satchel with dates, a waterskin, and a map his grandfather had given him. Saudi waved goodbye to his friends and family, promising to return with stories of his adventures.
